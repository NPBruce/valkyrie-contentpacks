Road to Legend

-Includes-"

CAMPAIGN_1_TITLE, "Rise of All Goblins"
CAMPAIGN_1_DESCRIPTION, "Leap to the aid of an unlikely friend—Splig, King of All Goblins! Is the end of all goblins truly nigh, or are you only a pawn of Splig's latest scheme?"
CAMPAIGN_1_CONTENTS, "-Includes-
2 Story Quests
2 Side Quests
6 Bonus Quests
6 Travel Events
New Perils"
CUTSCENE_1_PROLOGUE, "Your adventure begins with a note shoved under your door. Scrawled in large, unpracticed letters: \n\n[i]Hey stupid heroes! \n\nEverything is terrible! The Lair of All Goblins has been overrun by wicked things that dumb heroes like you always fight. You must come here, beat them up, and break their things to stop the unthinkable: the end of all goblins! You obviously don’t know where the Lair of All Goblins is, so I drew a map. Don’t lose it!\n\nYour fearsome master, \n\nSplig\n\n[/i]The map is rough but legible, leading to a place you clearly recognize as the Parigreth ruins. Having nothing better to do, you gather your gear and depart."
CUTSCENE_1_DEFEAT, "Two days after your assault, Splig’s horde has regrown to its previous size. For all of his alarm and fearmongering, he is now quite content to sit back and let the tribute pile up around him. \n\nBeyond the walls of a makeshift pen you lie chained and broken. On occasion, you are paraded about Splig’s throne room, dressed in tattered rags and armed with wooden swords.\n\nYou have become Splig’s finest treasure: the Fools of All Goblins."
CUTSCENE_1_VICTORY, "Upon your return, you coax your bruised bodies up the stairs to your room. Inside, you find another note. The script is large and familiar: \n\n[i]Hey stupid heroes, \n\nThis is why no one likes you. I ask for help and instead you beat up my subjects and break my things. You were supposed to STOP the End of All Goblins, not make it worse! For this, you shall be punished. Surrender your wealth, food, and selves, or the next time we meet, I won’t be so nice.\n\nYour REALLY fearsome master,\n\nSplig\n\nKing of All Goblins[/i]"
CAMPAIGN_1_SKIPPED_TUTORIAL,"[i]A brief investigation into Splig's message served little purpose, though the goblin king appears to have stepped up his efforts to prevent the purported ""end of all goblins."" At his request, goblin tribes from all corners of the realm are on the move, gathering in the foothills northwest of Tamalir.\n\nYour modestly experienced party, laden with a modest sum of gold, arrives on the outskirts of Tamalir, one of the greatest cities in Terrinoth.[/i]\n\nPlayers should travel to Tamalir to purchase better equipment or depart on a quest to gather more fame and fortune!"

CAMPAIGN_2_TITLE, "Kindred Fire"
CAMPAIGN_2_DESCRIPTION, "Lord Merick Farrow is burning with unquenchable wrath! Hurry to discover the reason for the mad mage's rampage, for he leaves only ash in his wake."
CAMPAIGN_2_CONTENTS, "8 New Story Quests!
2 New Side Quests!
All New Travel Events & Perils!
Access to all side quests provided\nby the products in your collection!"
CAMPAIGN_2_TEASER_1,"Villages and towns lie in ruin. \nThe mage, Lord Merick Farrow, is responsible."
CAMPAIGN_2_TEASER_2,"He cares only for his quest. \nHis brother, Sir Alric, is missing…"
CAMPAIGN_2_TEASER_3,"[i]Kindred Fire[/i] is a campaign expansion for [i]Road to Legend[/i], setting heroes upon the trail of Merick Farrow's devastation. The expansion features all new Story and Side Quests, new Travel Events and Perils, and access to all Side Quests provided by products in your collection!"
CUTSCENE_2_PROLOGUE, "Flakes of soft ash fall from the sky and coat the ground as you walk through a small village. You were dispatched to investigate commotion in the settlement, a stepping stone on the road to Castle Thelys. You thought to deal with bandits or to deliver the village from a goblin threat, but you found something else instead. \n\nThe village lies in silent ruin. Not a single building stands as more than a twisted pile of glowing ember. Scorch marks of arcane fire decorate the area, and of the village's population there is no sign. \n\nA set of footprints lies within the falling ash, starting in the village center and leading out into the nearby hills. Whether they belong to the perpetrator or a witness, this appears to be your only lead."
CUTSCENE_2_DEFEAT,"You stand upon a hill outside a fortress in flames, watching as Sir Alric leads his army in a devastating attack. Though offering a valiant struggle, the defenders have fallen back time and again, now barring themselves behind the gates of the keep and praying that reinforcements arrive soon. \n\nYou look to your companions. A set of glowing red eyes opens just above their own, and you feel the prickling heat of Sir Alric's gaze as your master's silent command comes forth. You signal your forces to march down the hill toward the keep. \n\nIndeed, reinforcements have arrived."
CUTSCENE_2_VICTORY,"Each of the monstrosities lies unmoving, and there remains no trace of Sir Alric's red-eyed gaze within them. The fallen knight himself kneels before you. His armor battered and sword broken, he attempts to rise as the fierce crimson light within his eyes softens to a pale glow.\n\nHe falls, growing silent and still. With a final exhalation, a thin black mist rises from his armor for a few moments, evaporating into the air. \n\nWhen it is done, Sir Alric is well and truly gone; all that remains is a suit of cold armor and a deep sense of peace and finality. Perhaps, now, the knight has found his rest."

TUTORIAL_2,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nBecoming knocked out has an added danger in Road to Legend. Each time a hero is knocked out, Morale (displayed in the upper-left corner) decreases by 1. If a hero is knocked out when Morale is already at 0 (indicated by a skull on the morale counter), the heroes lose the quest!"
TUTORIAL_3,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nEach round starts with a hero’s turn. Similar to the standard rules of Descent, heroes decide their turn order, and each hero performs 2 actions. For this tutorial, someone should start by reviving {0}.\n\n[u]Perform the Following:[/u]\n\n Players choose a hero other than {0}. For the chosen hero's first action, he should perform a revive action on {0}; make sure to roll two red dice and have {0} recover ≥ and ∏ as normal."
TUTORIAL_2HERO,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nPlease note, when playing with two heroes, the heroes receive an additional advantage (introduced in errata 1.6 and subsequent rulebooks). Once during each hero’s turn, that hero may perform one attack that does not require an action. This attack cannot be a special action that includes an attack (“Rage” or “Exploding Rune” for example); the attack must be a regular attack action. This attack can only be performed during the “Perform Actions” step of the hero turn and can be performed before or after either of his actions. \nAt the end of each hero’s turn, if that hero did not or could not perform the free attack during his turn, he may instead recover 2 ≥. "
TUTORIAL_4,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nWhen a hero is knocked out, players must select the hero's portrait and select the ""[b]KO[/b]"" button. In this tutorial, {0} was knocked out automatically (marked by the red ""X"" over the hero's portrait on the left).\n\nConversely, when a knocked-out hero recovers ≥, such as through the revive action, players must inform Road to Legend that the hero is no longer knocked out.\n\n[u]Perform the Following:[/u]\n\nSelect the portrait of {0} and then select the ""[b]Recover[/b]"" button."

TUTORIAL_SEARCHING_3,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nRoad to Legend doesn't need to know when a hero starts his turn, but it does need to know when that turn has concluded. Now that the knocked-out hero has been revived and the search token has been searched, the hero who performed these actions is finished.\n\n[u]Perform the Following:[/u]\n\nSelect that hero's portrait and then select the ""[b]End Turn[/b]"" button."
TUTORIAL_SEARCHING_4,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nA second hero can now take his turn. If the heroes wish to discover the nature of Splig's plight, they'll have to continue exploring this dungeon.\n\n[u]Perform the Following:[/u]\n\nChoose a different hero to resolve his turn. Perform a ""Move"" action, move that hero adjacent to the door, and perform an ""Open Door"" action. Select the door on the screen and then select the ""[b]Confirm[/b]"" button to open it (he will have to close this message to do so)."

TUTORIAL_11B,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nPlayers can activate individual minions (or masters) in any order. For this tutorial, however, players will start with the minion zombie closest to the heroes. "
TUTORIAL_12,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nThe first action instructs the zombie to engage the closest hero (the one who opened the door). When a monster engages, it performs a move action and moves toward a particular space, in this case the space that contains the closest hero. During this movement, the monster spends as few movement points as possible and stops when it is adjacent  to that space or has no movement points remaining.\n\n[u]Perform the Following:[/u]\n\nResolve the zombie's first action."
TUTORIAL_14_1,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nThere are many small choices to make while playing Road to Legend, such as what route the monster should take. When not given explicit instruction, players should make the decision quickly and continue playing."
TUTORIAL_15,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nThe second action instructs the zombie to attack a hero, which resolves per the standard rules of Descent. However, many monsters have clarifications for their abilities, in particular how they spend ± results."
TUTORIAL_15_1,"Road to Legend provides these clarifications for player reference in the info panel at the top of the screen.\n\n[u]Perform the Following:[/u]\n\nSelect the info button to display the info panel."
TUTORIAL_16,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nWhen attacking, zombies will spend the first ± to Disease the hero, but only if the zombie is dealing ≥ (because of the core rule that you need to deal ≥ in order to apply a condition). If spending a surge would have no effect, proceed down the list to the next ± ability."

TUTORIAL_18,"[u]Tutorial[/u]\n\nThe second action instructs the zombie to attack, which it cannot resolve because it's a Melee monster. If a monster cannot fulfill the conditions of a particular action, it skips the entirety of that action and attempts the next one. This cycles back to the top of the action list if necessary until 2 actions in total have been performed.\n\nNote that action restrictions for monsters still apply. Because zombies have the ""Shambling"" ability, the minion cannot perform the action at the top of the list (it already moved once). It still cannot attack, so there's nothing remaining in the list that the zombie can perform. If a monster has only used 1 action but there's nothing in its list that it can perform, its activation ends."

Q_GWWBK_MAP,"[u]The Goblin Who Would be King[/u]\n\n[i]Unconvinced that the threat has passed, or perhaps exploiting the opportunity for all it is worth, Splig has summoned the goblin tribes from far and wide to rally against the supposed ""end of all goblins.""[/i]\n\nThis is the finale.

Q_GWWBK_INFO,"[i]Unconvinced that the threat has passed, or perhaps exploiting the opportunity for all it is worth, Splig has summoned the goblin tribes from far and wide to rally against the supposed ""end of all goblins.""

This unification is no longer about self preservation—it is only a matter of time before the horde begins to pillage the surrounding villages.[/i]"
Q_GWWBK_SETUP_1,"[i]High upon a hill, an ancient fortress is alive with the ruckus of the goblin tribes. Dozens of banners have been shoddily hoisted into the air, marking out the various camps. The larger banners are closer to the fortress; as it is with all things goblin, the bigger, the better. You infiltrate deep into the camp when at last you are spotted, thanks to the endless party that rages around you.[/i]"
Q_GWWBK_SETUP_2,"[i]Many of the tribes flee at the first sign of conflict, but those closest to the fortress stand their ground.

Q_GWWBK_SETUP_3,"[i]Splig, the king of all goblins, sits upon his throne, an enormous pile of stones with the largest boulder on top. ""So you're the cause of this disruption,"" he calls out, ""I should have guessed. "" He adjusts himself on the boulder, trying to get comfortable.

Q_GWWBK_VALADIR,"Sir Valadir slowly raises his hand to his head and squints to see Splig's helmet clearly. ""Hey, isn't that…"" he mutters, but Splig cuts him off."
Q_GWWBK_SETUP_4,"[i]""I'd tell you to leave, but the time has come for the kingdom of all goblins to take a stand against the injustices imposed by your kind."" He stands, causing his dais to resettle another few inches lower. ""From this hour forth, let it be known that the end of all goblins is no more—a new age has dawned. The rise of all goblins is now!"" he bellows, deftly leaping upon his throne for effect. His subjects roar their approval and brandish their weapons."
Q_GWWBK_SETUP_5,"[i]But the boulder is no longer stable, and Splig, king of all goblins, topples forward and down.

Q_GWWBK_SPLIG_NO_HELP,"[i]""To me, my brethren,"" Splig announces, ""The trap is sprung!"" His command rings hollow as it echoes through the hall.

//Quest: Wake of Fire
Q_WOF_PREFACE, "[i]It is not difficult to follow the lone set of tracks from the smoldering village—pockets of scorched earth dot the land so close together that you can easily see from one to the next. But now, for the first time, you spot signs of an active strike. A plume of thick smoke bends into the sky, its origin not a mile to the east. Donning what armor you have, you rush forward into the thick forest that stands between you and your quarry."
Q_WOF_SETUP_FLAVOR, "[i]The smell of ash becomes unmistakable as you push from a thicket into the hazy clearing. To your left, a large temple was carved into the cliff side, though the beauty of its craftsmanship has been lost in an age long past. Its windows and doors expel endless streams of billowing smoke, and beyond, a few flickers indicate the light of a growing fire. The bodies of its defenders lie all around you, charred and lifeless. Across the clearing, however, more figures loom: tense, still, waiting for your advance."

Q_WOF_HALLWAY_LOCKED_DOOR,"[i]A large, bronze door stands firmly closed to your right. Levers, cogs, and plates of brass cover its face. Across the floor in front of you, streams of red stain the worn marble, as if projected from the door."

Q_WOF_SEARCHRELIC, "[i]The first shafts of light reveal what appears to be a barren room, the only remarkable feature being a skeleton slumped in the center of the floor. As the door swings wide, however, you notice thousands of etchings on the wall: tallies, equations, unknown symbology. Upon closer inspection of the mysterious occupant, you find a shard of iron in one hand, and in its other, a set of dice carved from bone.\n\nYou rotate the cubes between your fingers, examining their faces, but quickly realize that they possess a strange magic—no face is ever the same. Unable to examine them further, you store the dice in a pocket and turn back to your quest.[/i]\n\nYou have found Fortuna's Dice!\n\nPlace the ""Fortuna's Dice"" relic in the play area of the active hero.

Q_WOF_KILDARTH_REVEAL, "[i]Smoke billows out of the doorway, forcing you to duck beneath it. As the haze clears, you see Merick standing above one of the cultists.

You call out, and as Lord Merick Farrow turns, the man scurries for the exit. ""I'll kill him later,"" Merick growls, ""for now, you are mine!""\n\nThe fires, smoke, and ash begin to churn between you and him…"
Q_WOF_MERICK_REVEAL, "Place Merick as shown."
Q_WOF_MERICK_DEFEAT,"[i]Sidestepping your killing blow, Merick sinks shin-deep into the lava. Though his robes burn and he is engulfed in flame, he displays no sign of pain or fear.

Q_WOF_QUEST_COMPLETED, "[i]The rapid change in temperature is strange. With the mage and his wrath defeated, the many fires seem to calm and smoke begins to clear. Remembering the cultist who escaped out the back door, you take one quick look around, then sprint back into the cool, fresh air.[/i]\n\nYou win!"
Q_WOF_QUEST_WIN,"[i]You spread out, searching the wood for the surviving cultist, but there is no sign. Though he has escaped for now, Lord Merick Farrow showed particular interest in the man. It may be best to search for him yourself, perhaps getting a step or two ahead of the mad mage. If nothing else, you may be able to learn more about the reason for Merick's rampage."
Q_WOF_QUEST_LOSE,"[i]The heat and smoke become overwhelming and you are forced back outside before you can complete the fight. You watch from the tree line, but as the minutes pass, no survivors appear. Just as you are ready to leave, you hear a manic cackle and witness a heavily singed cultist sprinting from a back entrance. Cloaked in fire, Lord Merick Farrow follows, but he cares not for the flames that consume him.\n\n""I will find you,"" Merick screams. ""You cannot escape me, Kildarth. You will tell me where they have taken Alric!"" His body shudders rapidly, then shatters into sparks and cinder.\n\nYou retreat back from the complex and then take a moment to come up with a plan. If you can locate Kildarth before Merick does, you may be able to get ahead of the mad mage and put an end to his rampage without another direct confrontation."

//Quest: Kildarth the Marked
Q_KTF_INFO,"[u]Kildarth the Marked[/u]\n\n[i]The cultist, Kildarth, has fled from Merick. You believe he has retreated to a remote temple, a sanctuary from his younger years. He may be able to tell you more about Merick's motives."
Q_KTF_LOSE,"[i]You found Kildarth's body in the back room. His condition is not worth recounting. Merick must have gained the information he sought, as the mage seemed strangely joyous when you saw him. Your only choice now is to draw Merick out and confront him directly…"
Q_KTF_PREFACE, "[i]The remote temple is difficult to find, and the surrounding area is filled with many dangerous creatures and foes. As you approach the crumbling structure, you notice a thin line of smoke drifting from a hole in the roof on the far side of the complex. You cannot be certain, but this is your best lead on Kildarth's location."
Q_KTF_INTRO,"[i]A party of goblins hunters has become the prey, driven into the temple by the merriods they intended for food. They spring forward, unleashing wild shots, then bolt back as the brutes charge in. Though they appear to be quite proficient at the maneuver, the numerous mangled bodies that lie about the opening lead you to believe that some goblins may be quicker than others.[/i]"

Q_BH_ELIZAFAIL, "[i]You locate the source of the melody, for the tune cuts off abruptly as long fangs plunge into your neck![/i]\n\nLady Eliza Farrow performs an attack that targets the hero with the least Health remaining. Reroll all X results."
Q_BH_ELIZAPASS, "[i]You cannot see her, but you know she is there. As her foul fangs prick your neck, you duck to the side and step just out of reach![/i]"

Q_BH_FINALEREADY, "[i]Down the winding hallway, you hear feet shuffling and the voices of guards preparing for combat.[/i]"
Q_BH_ELIZA_RETURN,"[i]Red mist curls from beneath the door on the far side of the room. The haze thickens, then breaks before the figure emerging from it: Lady Eliza Farrow. She stalks forward, unsurprised and unimpressed by your presence.[/i]\n\nPlace Eliza as shown."

Q_BH_BIGGUYTEST, "Each hero tests μ. Did every hero pass?"
Q_BH_BIGGUYSPASS, "[i]Furthermore, as you peer around the corner, you notice a massive {0}. The creature's back rises and falls slowly, and its head is resting upon the earth.[/i]\n\nPlace 1 {0} on 2B."
Q_BH_BIGGUYSFAIL, "[i]As you inch forward, loose pebbles shift beneath your feet. A large {0} emerges from the darkness, ready to confront any who trespass.[/i]\n\nPlace 1 {0} on 2B."
Q_BH_ALRICDEFEAT,"[i]Alric's attacks are wild and unruly. If not for his immense strength and full plate, the fight would have been long over.\n\nHis allies driven back and his defenses finally weakening, you push your advantage. The room echoes with the sound of the ceaseless melee.\n\nWith no other hope, Alric turns and strikes the bars from the locked door on the far side of the room. ""I return,"" he shouts, ""take me!"" Immediately, the door swings open and a host of ghouls pours in, each with a set of glowing eyes above their own. With reckless abandon, the creatures swarm around him and create a wall of flesh between you and he.\n\nIt does not take much effort to slay the horde, but in that time, Alric retreats. You quickly search the room for further clues and treasures, then hurry out the way you came.[/i]\n\nYou win!"
Q_BH_LOSE,"[i]Unable to locate Alric, you fall back and take up a position on the southern hills. The next morning, before the fog fully clears, you hear the rattle of the castle's portcullis. You hurry to the road and arrive just in time to see a procession marching away. At its head, Alric leads the legion of soldiers, each with a set of fiery eyes above their own and in varying degrees of decomposition.\n\nFrom the ramparts behind you, a voice calls out, shrill and startling in the stillness of the morning.\n\n""Alric, you cannot do this, my brother."" Lady Eliza Farrow stands upon the wall above the gate, calling out. ""Merick brought you here for safety. You cannot return to Hestion—do not bend to that monster's will!"" Desperation building in her voice, she leans out from the wall. ""What am I supposed to tell Merick when he returns?""\n\nIf Alric can hear her, he shows no sign. The morning mists swallows the knight and his entourage. You glance back at Eliza, but see only a thin wisp of red streaming quickly to the west."
Q_BH_FINALE_PREP,"[i]Alric has returned to Hestion. Clearly this is the source of all your troubles. Whatever the plan of Hestion may be, it must be stopped. You begin to inquire as to the location of his lair."
Q_BH_OBJECTIVE_1,"Proceed with stealth and locate Alric."

Q_BH_SEARCH_TRAP,"[i]A decaying hand snaps out at you, pulling you into the darkness from which it spawned![/i]\n\nTest π."
Q_BH_SEARCH_TRAP_PASS,"[i]You resist the pull of the foul limb. Before your very eyes, it decays further, withering away until it can no longer hold you.[/i]\n\nDiscard this token and draw a Search card!"
Q_BH_SEARCH_TRAP_FAIL_SELECT,"[i]The decaying hand yanks you into its domain…[/i]\n\nSelect the portrait of the hero who searched."
Q_BH_SEARCH_TRAP_FAIL,"[i]The blackness that awaits you is void: neither cold nor hot, neither open nor full. You drift for a long while, unsure whatever happened to the others you traveled with. Did they succeed at their quest? Did they die happy? How long has it been since you misstepped into this realm? When had— "
Q_BH_SEARCH_TRAP_FAIL_CONT,"[i]—a silver claw reaches out from no where in particular and tears you back. You stand in a musty cave, your knees weak and shaky. Down the hall, you hear the din of battle. You take a step forward and something clatters across the floor…[/i]\n\nRemove the figure of {0} from the map and place it in the indicated space. Place zombies as shown."
Q_BH_SEARCH_TRAP_FAIL_CONT_REPLACE,"[i]Once again, the silver claw tears into your reality and pulls you through the breach.

//Quest: Hestion's Host
Q_HH_MAP,"[u]Hestion's Host[/u]\n\n[i]Hestion's fortress is reported to be a little more than a mile within the Hedge. Though the thick forest will make your journey difficult, it may also provide the cover you need to approach unseen, slipping behind the primary defenses of Hestion's host.[/i]\n\nThis is the finale. The outcome of this quest determines the outcome of your campaign."
Q_HH_PREFACE, "[i]Overnight, sightings of Alric begin to pour in, but their details are strange. In one, he moves like the wind; in another, he is ten feet tall. While you would normally pass this off as fearful wonder by the storytellers, there are also stranger details: two of him at once and a few claiming he was female. In truth, only two details remain consistent across all of the tales: the golden suit the creatures bore and the pair of burning eyes above their helms.\n\nThe time has come to end this. You hurry through the dark wood surrounding Hestion's fortress until you spot the ancient castle in the distance.[/i]"
Q_HH_SETUP_FLAVOR, "[i]You spot a lower entrance along the north side of the structure. A few guards mill about the gully. You slink down into the near-dry moat. To your right, you hear the shuffle of armored feet, but no one has yet noticed your presence. You close in quickly."

Q_HH_NAMED_MARS_REVEAL, "[i]In the moments before the final clash, one last horror emerges. Behind Alric stands his faithful hound. Its shoulders rise to the height of Alric's own.

This is Mars.\n\n{0}"
Q_HH_ALRIC_REVEAL, "[i]In the center of the room stands Alric, a bloody maul in his hand. At his feet lies Hestion. After weeks of investigation and struggle, it looks like Alric has beaten you to the final blow.\n\nAll is not resolved, however.  You look into his burning eyes and understand for the first time: Alric is the heart of this host of mutants. Hestion has been harvesting and channeling his power, attempting to mimic the knight's undying nature into his own army. Though the mastermind is dead, you can see the undying knight's intent—he will lead this army of abominations instead![/i]\n\nPlace Sir Alric Farrow as shown. At the end of each round, Alric recovers ≥ equal to the number of remaining mutants on the map."
Q_HH_ALRIC_HEAL, "Sir Alric Farrow recovers {0} ≥."
Q_HH_MERICK_REVEAL_2, "[i]To your right, Merick watches passively. His eyes dart between Alric, Hestion, and you. There is a deep fear in those eyes. A fear of what Alric has become? Or perhaps the mad mage has finally realized that Alric is gone—to a greater extent than ever before, his brother is gone.\n\nNevertheless, Lord Merick Farrow steps forward. ""To the death then…"" he croaks. The streams of tears evaporate from his face with a hiss as he engulfs himself in flame.[/i]\n\nPlace Lord Merick Farrow as shown. Lord Merick Farrow will defend his brother to the death."
Q_HH_SACRIFICE_MARS, "[i]With a display of impossible speed, Mars leaps before your killing blow. Even before the beast's body hits the ground, Merick is channeling its life energy into his dying brother.[/i]\n\nAlric recovers ≥ equal to Mars' remaining Health. Then Mars is defeated."
Q_HH_SACRIFICE_MERRICK, "[i]""Never!"" Merick screams, throwing himself before your mortal blow. His lifeless body leaves a red smear across the marble floor as it slides to a stop.

Q_HH_MUTATIONS_REVEAL_1, "[i]Entering the room, you immediately take a step back. Dozens of golden suits fill this room. Though most are empty, a few are inhabited by strange abominations. Each is clearly distinct from the other, but also a clear variation of Sir Alric Farrow. Those that show signs of life all bear a telling mark: above the eye slits of their helms, a pair of burning orbs flickers brightly.[/i]\n\nPlace 4 villager tokens as shown. These are mutants."
Q_HH_MUTATIONS_REVEAL_2, "[i]To your surprise, this back room contains just as many suits of gold and abominations within. They turn toward you, glowing eyes ablaze.[/i]\n\nPlace 4 mutants as shown."

Q_HH_MUTANT_INTERACT_GENERAL, "Interact with this mutant?"
Q_HH_MUTANT_1_INTERACT,"[i]This mutant is missing its right arm, which lies on the ground nearby. The flesh at the shoulder has decomposed to the point of being little more than rancid goo.[/i]\n\nThis mutant blocks movement.\n\nAs an action, a hero adjacent to this mutant can test ∑."

Q_HH_MUTANT_1_FAIL, "[i]You reach for the creature, but your hand slips on the slimy armor and slides between the plates. The malleable flesh gives way , and your arm plunges deep in to the body. The corrupted flesh burns away at your own![/i]\n\nThe hero who tested is Poisoned and suffers 2 ≥."
Q_HH_MUTANT_2_INTERACT,"[i]This mutant flails about endlessly, striking out at the wall, her shadow, and even herself. It will be difficult to get close…[/i]\n\nThis mutant blocks movement.\n\nAs an action, a hero adjacent to this mutant can submit himself to an attack from the mutant. That hero is attacked as if by Sir Alric Farrow. If he suffers no ≥ from the attack, discard this mutant."

Q_HH_MUTANT_3_FAIL, "[i]You duck the left blade as it whistles through the air. The right plunges into your thigh, but immediately retracts. The left strikes your shoulder, the right slices across your forearm, the left glances off your skull—you stagger back.[/i]\n\nThe hero who tested suffers 4 ≥."
Q_HH_MUTANT_4_INTERACT,"[i]Suspended in the air above you, one of the mutants struggles against its chains. At this distance, with the way it writhes, it will be a struggle to land a killing blow.[/i]\n\nThis mutant blocks movement.\n\nAs an action, a hero can perform a ranged attack that targets this mutant. If the Range results exceeds the necessary Range by 6 or more, discard this mutant."
Q_HH_MUTANT_4_PASS, "[i]You time the motion of the creature's thrashing. Releasing a single bolt, the creature spasms and then becomes immediately still.[/i]\n\nDiscard this mutant."
Q_HH_MUTANT_4_FAIL, "[i]Attack after attack ricochets off of the creature's armor. The damage is negligible…[/i]"
Q_HH_MUTANT_5_INTERACT,"[i]A hulking suit of armor stands before you, wavering back and forth under its own wait. Its plates are impossibly thick, yet the mutant contained within manages to raise its shield arm to your approach.[/i]\n\nThis mutant blocks movement.\n\nAs an action, a hero can perform an attack that targets this space. The defense result is 8 ≤. If the attack deals ≥, discard this mutant."
Q_HH_MUTANT_5_PASS, "[i]Abandoning skill and tactics, you step in and deliver a single blow, directly to the center of the creature's armor. With all the power and effort you can muster, you shatter the plate and pass through to the abomination within.[/i]\n\nDiscard this mutant."
Q_HH_MUTANT_UI_DISCARD,"Discard"
Q_HH_MUTANT_5_FAIL, "[i]Stepping to the side, you deliver a quick blow to an opening in the armor, but beneath the first layer, another plate waits![/i]"
Q_HH_MUTANT_6_INTERACT,"[i]He has four arms. Four arms, spinning and twirling the four blades he bears. Stranger still, you're not sure which pair was added and which is natural. The creature drops into a defensive stance, waiting for your advance.[/i]\n\nThis mutant blocks movement.\n\nAs an action, a hero can perform an attack that targets this space. That attack cannot deal ≥, but gains: ±±±: Discard the target mutant."
Q_HH_MUTANT_6_PASS, "[i]Despite the multiple arms, the creature has not yet mastered their use. Though it parries your first few blows, your true skill overcomes and the mutation dies.[/i]\n\nDiscard this mutant."
Q_HH_MUTANT_6_FAIL, "[i]Your technique is masterful, but each time you expect to slip past the creature's defenses, another blade is there, batting your attack aside![/i]"
Q_HH_MUTANT_7_INTERACT,"[i]Something is very wrong here. The creature's flesh slowly turns in on itself, shifting across its frame and then disappearing between its bones and organs. Nevertheless, it manages to always keep an eye on you as you approach. It does not put up a defense, however; perhaps it is ready to die…[/i]\n\nThis mutant blocks movement.\n\nAs an action, an adjacent hero can test π."
Q_HH_MUTANT_7_PASS, "[i]With a single blow, you decapitate the foul beast. When it doesn't fall, however, you attack again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd again…[/i]\n\nDiscard this mutant."

Q_HH_MUTANT_7_FAIL_FAIL,"[i]You tremble before the foul creature. The world begins to spin around you and you feel your own flesh begin to crawl and slip between your bones.\n\n""Run!"" you scream, unable to control yourself.

Q_HH_MUTANT_8_INTERACT,"[i]Short and stout, the mutant stands ready at the center of this short bridge. Its muscles bulge, stretching its flesh like a wineskin ready to burst.[/i]\n\nThis mutant blocks movement.\n\nAs an action, an adjacent hero can test ∂."
Q_HH_MUTANT_8_PASS, "[i]The creature uses your own momentum against you and diverts you to the side of the bridge. You do not resist, however, and continue the motion. You grasp the creature's wrist as it shoves you over the side. Catching the rope with your other hand, you pull the abomination over, release its arm, and swing back beneath the rope, rolling to your feet safely upon the bridge.[/i]\n\nDiscard this mutant."
Q_HH_MUTANT_8_FAIL, "[i]With a swift sweep of its arm, the creature wraps both of your arms to the side and plants its free palm into your side! You struggle for breath from the blow, but the abomination does not stop there. Changing direction, it lifts you into the air with the hand on your abdomen and flips you over the side of the bridge.[/i]\n\nThe hero who tested places his figure in the closest empty pit space."
Q_HH_WIN, "[i]You did not comprehend the oppression until now, but as you land the final blow, knocking the undying knight from his feet, you feel the darkness fade.\n\nYou feel the link between Alric and his host unravel and dissipate into the air.\n\nYou feel as if you can breathe again."

Q_MMT_PREFACE,"[i]Years ago, following a late-summer flood, many bodies emerged from a mass, unmarked grave. There was more below the surface, however. Before the locals even knew they were there, a colony of corpse bugs escaped the pit and soon began to multiply. A local hermit, powerful yet shunned, quickly crafted a tower to repel the vermin. The dark structure came to life late one evening, rumbling and spewing green fumes in every direction.\n\nBy the next morning, the majority of the bugs had fled, and those that did not, perished.

Q_TOTED_FINALE_WHITE,"[i]The spirit with the bow glides high into the chamber, releasing gales of howling wind into the wretched beast.[/i]\n\nThe dragon suffers 5 ≥ and is Immobilized."
Q_TOTED_FINALE_BLUE,"[i]The dragon rears back and snaps forward, releasing a jet of flame. The warrior carrying the shield dives forward, intercepting the blast and absorbing it entirely.

//Quest: The Demon Hive
Q_TDH_MAP,"[u]The Demon Hive[/u]\n\n[i]Some kind of horrid nest has appeared in a nearby valley. Local authorities have asked you to look into the matter and examine the threat it poses."
Q_TDH_LOSE,"[i]You pass through a very long night in the dark of this wretched place. Hunted at every turn, you slay dozens of the vicious creatures only to be assault by a score of others. Eventually, you manage to find a way out, but the wounds you sustained make for very slow progress. By the time you deliver your report, the infestation may be quite out of hand."
Q_TDH_ALL_TILES,"Set aside tiles 7, 13, 38, and 39."
Q_TDH_PREFACE,"[i]Black, chitinous brambles and thorns have overgrown the forest near the valley, choking out the usual flora you'd expect to find here. This was not quite what you were expecting when asked to investigate."
Q_TDH_INTRO_FLAVOR,"[i]The forest floor collapses beneath your feet, sending you tumbling down a path and landing at the edge of a clearing. Several vicious creatures in the clearing immediately notice you, uttering sharp clicking sounds and brandishing scythe-like limbs. It would seem you are unwelcome here, but the only way is forward."
Q_TDH_INTRO_TILES,"Place the Entrance, 38A, 2 doors, and 2 end caps. Place the heroes on the Entrance."

As an action, an adjacent hero can retrieve it."
Q_TDH_KEY_2,"[i]An identical pedestal lies ahead, containing an identical mass of odd organic matter. This one seems to quiver with a little more livelihood.[/i]\n\nPlace 1 objective token as shown.

Q_TDH_KEY_PICKUP_2,"[i]At your approach, as before, the mass springs from its pedestal. At the same time, the mass attached to your arm releases and flings itself at the other one. There's a quick flash of light and a sound like a heavy, wet thud as they collide, and what looks and feels like a stone sphere falls to the ground. Of their original nature, there is no sign.[/i]\n\nPlace the token on the hero's Hero sheet."

Q_TDH_MOUNTAIN_TILES,"Place 39A, 2 end caps, and 1 exit."
Q_TDH_MOUNTAIN_FLAVOR,"[i]Much of the valley is in full view now, and it seems the potential concerns of local authorities were a little understated. For miles, the black chitinous thorns carpet the forest, strangling out the local flora. Worse, you see dozens, hundreds of the vicious creatures milling about, some not bearing the scythe-like forelimbs but rather appendages more suited for digging and other work.\n\nYou have no idea what they might be doing here, but with the infestation at this size, there's not much for a small group like yours to do other than report the findings."
Q_TDH_MOUNTAIN_OVERGROWTH,"[i]Another of the twisted barriers lies ahead, though this one looks a bit weaker than the other one.[/i]\n\nThe overgrowth cannot be moved through as normal, but an adjacent hero can attack it as if it were a monster.

Q_TDH_MOUNTAIN_OVERGROWTH_DEFEAT,"[i]With a final hack, the overgrowth comes apart. Running as fast as you can, the black, thorned terrain gives way to standard forest, and after a while you find yourselves no longer pursued. You'll have quite a report to give as soon as you get back.[/i]\n\nYou win!"
Q_TDH_REAVER_1,"Place 1 Volucrix Reaver on 38A."

Q_TTT_MAP,"[u]The Troll's Treasure[/u]\n\n[i]A caravan was recently raided, and a local lord has sent a request for someone to recover an heirloom of modest value that was stolen in the process. The posting assures that he only cares about the heirloom; in addition to a generous stipend, he mentions that the caravan had several other items of value that are not required in this recovery."
Q_TTT_LOSS,"[i]Abandoning the task, you make your way clear of the fortress and depart. As days pass and you recover from your wounds, you reflect upon your lack of success. Eventually, you arrive at the conclusion that the fetid swamp and anything within it very likely held nothing of value anyway."
Q_TTT_PREFACE,"[i]You track the caravan's looters to a half-sunken old fortress in a nearby marsh. The insects have been devouring you for days, and you pray this payoff will be worthwhile."

Q_TTT_OPEN_2," Place the {0} group on 44A."

Q_TTT_ETTIN_DOOR,"Place 48B, 1 locked door, and 2 end caps."
Q_TTT_ETTIN_FLAVOR,"[i]The structure gives way to an underground reservoir, filled with murky water. In the middle of the cave is a small mound of mud, featuring a scattering of filth and trinkets. Atop the mound lies not a troll as you were expecting but a sleeping ettin. The sound of two snoring heads fills the chamber.[/i]\n\nPlace 1 master Ettin, tipped on its side, ignoring group limits."

Then the Ettin performs an attack that targets the active hero."
Q_TTT_ETTIN_EMPTY,"[i]Nothing else you can immediately see on or around the ettin's bedding looks to be of any value."

Q_TTT_OPEN_3,"Place the {0} group on 48B."

Q_TTT_NOBLE,"[i]In a small, dim chamber, you find not heaping stacks of gold and other valuables, but a terrified young man garbed in nobleman's finery, albeit somewhat filthy. In his arms, he clutches a small chest, and immense relief floods over the young man's features when he sees you. ""Oh, thank the Gods. Did my father send you?""

Q_TTT_STEAL_RESULT,"[i]Without a word, you grab the chest he clutches and shove him backward. As he begins to protest, you slam the doors shut and lock them before tossing the key back into the ettin's filthy nest. You can hear muffled shouting and the sounds of soft pounding on the other side of the door as you depart."

Q_SAG_PREFACE,"[i]Supposedly the manor had only been vacant for a few months, but time and nature has rendered the interior in an advanced state of filth and disarray. Crisp afternoon air wafts from the dozens of shattered windows, mingling with the scent of the varied animal droppings throughout the area."
Q_SAG_INTRO_FLAVOR,"[i]Immediately upon arrival, you set about investigating the area, and within a couple of hours discover nothing of interest. The sun begins to sink behind the nearby hills as you conclude a search of the last room, the attic.

Q_SAG_PASS_STUDY,"[i]A tiny thread starts with a slight discrepancy between a creditor's note and a shipping manifest.

They both grasp at some pulsating black object held between them.[/i]\n\nAs an action, a hero can approach and test an attribute of his choice to examine the final memory. Add ≤ to the results equal to the Wraith's remaining Health."
Q_SAG_FINAL_PASS,"[i]This time, you don't partake of either figure's direct vision.

If you deliver it to them, hundreds of people will suffer!"" The mother glares at the youth with hate-filled eyes, letting out a bellow as she lunges forward."
Q_SAG_FINAL_PASS_2,"[i]The force of the woman's charge smashes the pair of them through the window in the attic, and you watch as they fall to the cobblestones below.

Q_TGOAI_MAP,"[u]The Glade of All Illusions[/u]\n\n[i]After the defense of Thelys, you received reports of Alric fleeing the area, headed north. A few days later, more rumors tell of a large goblin and a knight clad in golden armor escaping into an enchanted forest."
Q_TGOAI_PREFACE, "[i]You've been trudging through this forest for hours. Something is wrong here. A poison or curse hangs in the air, warping your thoughts.\n\nFor example, this bridge, you've crossed it before. Or perhaps you crossed this stream, but the bridge wasn't yet built. Except that it spans a chasm, and the stream is gone…\n\nYou refocus your thoughts…"

Q_TGOAI_GLADE_NE_TILES, "[i]The smell of the spices from the marble bridge is redoubled here. Large, dark flowers hang from a canopy of vines. They bend toward you as you step forward. A moment later, a cloud of violet pollen clouds the air.[/i]\n\nPlace 2A, 26A, and 1 end cap."

//Names of Nightfall
Q_NON_MAP,"[u]Names of Nightfall[/u]\n\n[i]The dead forest of Nightfall is said to be haunted, and in the darkness of night one can hear whispers in the trees. Though normally the words are believed to be nonsense, a clear name has begun to be repeated: {0}."
Q_NON_INFO,"[i]Nightfall Forest used to be a place of recreation and rest, but after an otherwise ordinary season of winter, the forest that sits high upon a plateau never came back to life. For the last few years, it is said that whispers can be heard calling through branches at night. Though normally dismissed as unconcerning hearsay, recent repetitions of a particular name warrants your attention: {0}."
Q_NON_ALL_TILES,"Set aside tiles 21, 78 (x2), 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, and 96."
Q_NON_INTRO,"[i]The climb to Nightfall forest is arduous, but when at last you approach the wood, no evil waits to greet you. You search all day, and it is not until the shadows grow long that you first hear the whispers calling. Strands of green light and bleached skulls begin to dance between the trees as the whispers become a mocking chant. The sounds seem mostly to be nonsense, but their truth grows clear—though rooted in unknown, forbidden, and forgotten tongues, these are all the names of {0} being spoken. With each repetition, these strange beings conjure power over your companion. Even the strongest of souls cannot withstand such an assault for long. \n\nYou must escape!"

Q_NON_ROOM_1_LOCKED_DOOR_OPEN,"[i]You throw your shoulder against the old wood, but the massive barrier barely gives, leaving your shoulder sore and your mind in a panic. The Keeper of Names shrieks a cruel laugh.\n\nGlancing around, you realize you have but one escape—far below you, a section of the moat has crumbled away, revealing an ancient chamber…[/i]\n\nWhen each hero is adjacent to a pit space, select any pit space and then select the ""Descend"" button."

Q_NON_ROOM_2B_MONSTERS_DISPO,"[i]As the tall doors swing open, you find the Keeper of Names waiting just beyond the threshold. His repetitious chant rises into a gleeful scream when he sees you.\n\nAt the opposite end of the chamber, you see your escape: another hole leads down.[/i]\n\nPlace Dispossessed as shown, ignoring group limits. The master is the Keeper of Names.\n\n{0}"
Q_NON_ROOM_2B_MONSTERS,"[i]Out of the depths, a creature constructed of bone and metal clambers from the darkness. It screeches aggressively when it sees you.

You sigh, thankful to have escaped that nightmare.[/i]\n\nEach hero may immediately discard the Terrified condition. Then select the portrait of the hero with the lowest μ who is in a water space."
Q_NON_ROOM_3A_WATER_DRAIN,"[i]With a sudden, low groan, a torrent of water pours into the chamber from both sides. The floor beneath {0} opens suddenly, swallowing the excess water and your companion down into the slimy tube. You hurry forward, but the metallic portal snaps shut before you can help.[/i]\n\nRemove {0} from the map. During that hero's turn, he cannot do anything other than the following special action:\n∞ Test ∂ or π. If you pass select the old wall and then the ""Destroy"" button."
Q_NON_ROOM_3_WALL,"[i]From behind the crumbling wall to the north, you hear the muffled screams of {0}![/i]\n\nAs an action, {0} or a hero adjacent to the old wall can test ∂ or π to destroy the wall. If you pass, select the old wall and then the ""Destroy"" button."
Q_NON_ROOM_3_DISPOSSESSED,"[i]Twisting from the shadows of the statues against the far wall, more Dispossessed appear, led by the Keeper of Names.[/i]\n\nPlace Dispossessed as shown, ignoring group limits. The master is the Keeper of Names.\n\n{0}"

Q_NON_ROOM_3C,"Place 94B and 1 end cap."
Q_NON_ROOM_3C_JUMP,"[i]Ahead, a crumbling walkway extends over misty darkness. What is worse, the far side leads to nothing but a collapsed passage. It appears that your only escape, once again, is down…[/i]\n\nWhen every hero is adjacent to a pit space, select any pit space and select the ""Descend"" button."
Q_NON_ROOM_4,"Place 88A, 95B, 2 end caps, 1 old wall, and 1 locked door.\n\nPlace the heroes in the indicated space. Then place any set-aside familiars as close as possible to the indicated space."
Q_NON_ROOM_4_MONSTERS,"[i]You have located an exit. Not just another temporary escape, but a true passage leading out of the haunted complex. Between you and the final gate, however, waits the Keeper of Names. The creature flickers and its chant dwindles back into a whisper. It has grown weaker, perhaps from the lingering light of the gloaming or distance from its lair. Now is your opportunity to strike and end this![/i]\n\nPlace Dispossessed as shown. The master is the Keeper of Names.\n\n{0}"
Q_NON_ROOM_4_MONSTERS_P,"Place Marrow Priests as shown, ignoring group limits."

Q_NON_ROOM_4_WALL,"[i]The walls slides back, revealing an old war room. Weapons and armor lay scattered across the floor, cracked, worn, and bloody.[/i]\n\nPlace 93B and 2 end caps.\n\n[i]A single set of footsteps breaks the blanket of dust on the floor. The right foot trailed slightly, limping toward the table. There, a red robe sits folded, unaffected by the years of dust. As you lift the soft material from its resting place, it occurs to you that no footsteps lead away from the table…[/i]\n\nYou have found the Robes of the Last!\n\nPlace the ""Robes of the Last"" relic in the play area of the active hero. He may immediately equip it."
Q_NON_WIN,"[i]One of the skulls topples from the amalgamation. Its jaw continues to move as it comes to rest at your feet, but the whispers have ceased. A swift blow from your heel shatters the bone, and the swirling mass of hate, power, and undeath shrieks and turns to retreat.\n\nYou close on it, severing another skull from its ethereal body before it can rally. The clambering hands begin to dissipate into the void, and the final skull turns back to you, gathering all of its power to rise up and look {0} straight in the eye. It opens its mouth for a final, cursing word, but {1} lands a blow that sends the jaw flying. The hollow eyes stare forward without expression, then it drops to the ground.\n\nYou leave it there, push the rusted gates open wide, and retreat from the shadow of this accursed land.[/i]\n\nYou win!"
Q_NON_LOSE,"[i]You awake to the screams of {0}. The sun has not yet risen, but even in the dim light of the early morning, you can see your companion shaking from whatever nightmare struck them.\n\nYou rise and ready yourselves for the climb. Haunting whispers have been heard in Nightfall forest, and it is rumored that the name of {0} is one of them. Perhaps this was the source of the nightmare.\n\nWhen you arrive at the top of the plateau, you find something odd—green sprouts decorate the trees and warm light sparkles through the branches. You begin your search, but are soon convinced that the rumors of a haunted forest with strange whispers are, in fact, only rumors. Even as you lose the light of the setting sun, the forest remains peaceful, a refuge from the cruel world below. You abandon the quest and return to the road before making camp."
Q_NON_LOSE_2,"[i]The next morning, you awake again to the terrified screams of {0}. Unable to recount the details of the nightmare, only a memory of descending through an endless mountain can be recalled. "
Q_NON_LOSE_3,"[i]The following morning and every morning thereafter, you awake to the screams, the terrifying, haunting screams…"
Q_NON_LOSE_LINGER,"{0} tests π."
Q_NON_LOSE_LINGER_BAD,"[i]""There!"" {0} yells, pointing toward a shadow. ""Did you see it? It found me—its here! My gods, it knows my name! It knows my name!""[/i]\n\n{0} is Terrified."
Q_NON_LOSE_LINGER_GOOD,"[i]{0} shudders, as if remembering a haunting memory. When you inquire later, it can only be explained as almost remembering something that never happened."
Q_NON_LOSE_LINGER_GOOD_FINAL,"[i]You remember everything: your ascent of Nightfall mountain, the hunt of the Keeper of Names, your fall to its power…\n\n""Get out!"" {0} screams, ""your power be rebuked!"" A creature forms from the shadows beneath your feet and you step back.\n\n""It matters not,"" its multi-skulled form intones, ""I have taken what I need. I shall return when your days are done. Then we will talk again."" The creature melts into another realm with a wicked laugh, but for now, {0} appears to have been freed from some great weight."
Q_NON_SEARCH_1,"[i]A gold sphere pulses with energy just below the surface of the muck."

Q_ARAC_PREFACE,"[i]The last two days of travel have been troubling—the vermin that previously were only a nuisance, now abound in every forest and abandoned building.

You ignore them, watching a hundred thin arms reach out for the sac and snag it from its fall—the last of the spiders' young is safe.\n\nNow you can only hope that they recognize your deeds. As the weapons and claws of your enemies sweep in for their killing blows, you close you eyes, tilt forward, and let yourselves topple into the dark rift.[/i]"
Q_ARAC_VICTORY_FLAVOR_CONT,"[i]You spin forward, head over heel, falling for longer than you had expected. Just as you lose hope that they will now save you, the first line of web snags your shoulder. Another secures your foot, then back, then arms; your descent slows and then stops. The long legs pull you in quickly and set you on a ledge. The creatures give you a long, knowing look, then scurry off.[/i]\n\nYou win!"
Q_ARAC_DEFEAT_FLAVOR,"[i]A swarm of spiders streams from holes in the walls and cracks in the floor. They nip at both you and your enemies, driving you back. Though you try to communicate that you are helping, they are far too interested in saving their young. The battle that follows is short but brutal. The final moments devolve into a chaotic brawl and you decide to withdraw while you have the chance, for you believe that the winner, no matter the side, will not welcome your presence.\n\nPerhaps this whole idea was a mistake…[/i]\n\nYour quest has failed!"
